|Holding=History and precedent support the conclusion that the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] was designed to preserve a jury trial in civil cases in instances of the most fundamental elements.  Here, speculation could not substitute for probative facts.  It was the Petitioner's burden to show by nature of the claim that he suffered from continuing and total disability for nearly twenty years. His inability to show the continuing disability, as per the statute, left his claim vague and incomplete and therefore properly subjected to a directed verdict.
