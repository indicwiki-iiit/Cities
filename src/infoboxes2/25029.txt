However, Boundary Peak can be considered a subsidiary summit of Montgomery Peak, whose summit is in California, since the [[topographic prominence]] of Boundary Peak is only {{convert|253|ft}}, which falls under the often used {{convert|300|ft|adj=on}} cutoff for an independent peak. Also, Boundary Peak is less than {{convert|1|mi}} away from its higher neighbor. Hence Boundary Peak can be described as not being wholly within Nevada. By contrast, the prominence of Wheeler Peak, {{convert|13063|ft}}, is quite large and in fact it is the twelfth largest in the contiguous United States. Wheeler Peak is the highest point in a radius of more than {{convert |200|sqmi}} and is entirely within the state of Nevada.}}
