 |caption = Painting of Tecumseh based on an 1808 sketch{{#tag:ref|This 1915 painting is based on a black-and-white engraving published by [[Benson John Lossing]] in 1868. Before Lossing's was published, no authentic portrait of Tecumseh was known to exist. Lossing said his portrait was based on a sketch of Tecumseh made in 1808 by Pierre Le Dru, a French trader in Vincennes. Lossing altered the original by putting Tecumseh in a British Army uniform, based on the erroneous belief that Tecumseh had been appointed a brigadier general.{{sfn|Sugden|1997|pp= facing 210, 402â€“03}}|group= note}}
