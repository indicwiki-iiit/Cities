| area_sqmi                       = 20<ref>This is the figure given in the [https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-John-island-United-States-Virgin-Islands article at the on-line edition of the ''Encyclopedia Britannica''].  It is not the figure given by the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands on the [https://www.usvi.net/st-john/ St. John] page of ''usvi.net'', which reports the area to be 28 square miles.  Other reliable sources report various figures closer to the Britannica figure.  The [http://islands.unep.ch/IWY.htm#415 Virgin Islands (United States) page] at the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]'s Island Directory gives the area as 50.0 square kilometers, equivalent to 19.3 square miles.  A 1998 paper issued by the [[United States Geological Survey]], [https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1631/P1631-tag.pdf Professional Paper 1631], reports the area as "about" 48 square kilometers, which is equivalent to 18.5 square miles (see page 1 of the paper).  And although the U.S. Census Bureau does not report the areas of geographic entities, it does report their population densities (equal to the total population divided by the area).  In the 2010 census, the population was reported as 4,170 (Table P1, "Total Population") and the population density was reported as 211.8 per square mile (Table P40, "Population Density").  Together, these figures imply an area of 19.7 square miles.</ref>
