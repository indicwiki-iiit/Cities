  |base_alt=Map. The eastern half of Lake Ontario runs across the top half of the map. The bottom half shows several slender lakes running north-south; these are the Finger Lakes. Oneida Lake and Wood Creek are to the east of the Finger Lakes, near the map's center. The map indicates numerous rivers flowing out of the Finger Lakes, out of Oneida Lake, and from other sources. These waters flow into Lake Ontario at Oswego.
