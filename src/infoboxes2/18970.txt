|static_image_alt = The junction of High Street and Church Road. A terrace of stone fronted buildings, with a curved corner building fronted in white, from the mid-late 19th century. The modern shop fronts are not in keeping the original style of the buildings. It is set back from the road by modern paving. The far section of the building is the old fire station building (formerly Urban District offices).
