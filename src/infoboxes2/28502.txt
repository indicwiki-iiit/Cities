<!-- The town of Kirkenes does not have a mayor - the municipality of Sør-Varanger has a mayor named Rune Rafaelson.  Only municipalities in Norway have mayors- towns and villages do not--towns and villages are located within a municipality, but don't have formal governmental roles, only municipalities have that role.
