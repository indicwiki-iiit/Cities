Accessed July 12, 2016. "Lyndhurst, a township situated between routes 3 and 21, offers another unexpected sign. Rolling past a 7-Eleven as traffic rushes by, 'Bear Country' is probably not what most people are thinking. But there it is: front and center on the town welcome sign, paired with a long-toothed bear head. (In reality, no actual bears are involved – just the Lyndhurst High School Golden Bears, the football team.)"</ref>
