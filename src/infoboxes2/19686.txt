| nationality   = [[Ottomanism|Ottoman]]<ref>The major precursors to Ottomanism were the Reformation Edict of 1856, which promised full equality regardless of religion, and the Ottoman Nationality Law of 1869, which created a common Ottoman citizenship, irrespective of religious or ethnic affiliation. The nationality legislation was a 19th-century concept, and the Ottoman Empire adopted it too early. The Ottoman Nationality Law appeared before any commonly-adopted international concept of the basic elements of this legislation. At that time Bulgaria was [[de jure]] [[vassal state]] under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Ottoman passport gave privileges when traveling into the Ottoman provinces. There are often cases when it is reported that the Ottoman authorities detain and do not recognize the passports of Bulgarian subjects traveling in the Empire, forcing them to obtain Ottoman passports.
