Accessed July 12, 2016. "Lawrence Township, in Mercer County, chose to capitalize on its square mileage with 'Where Nature Smiles for 22 Miles.' Joseph DallePazze, the town's mayor in the '70s and '80s, is credited with coining the motto, says township clerk Kathleen Norcia, even though, as sloganeer Swartz points out, the slogan is eerily reminiscent of Spring Lake Township, Michigan's motto, 'Where nature smiles for seven miles.'"</ref>
