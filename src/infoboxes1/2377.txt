"Allentown's title as the Peanut City goes back to the late 19th and early 20th century when large amounts of them were eaten in the Lehigh Valley. From the 1880s to the 1920s, vendors lined Hamilton Street, singing jingles in Pennsylvania Dutch about the superior quality of their peanuts. Former ''Call-Chronicle'' Sunday editor John Y. Kohl recalled in 1967 that the peanuts were eaten mostly by young men and boys who would walk Hamilton Street on Saturday nights flirting with girls and 'throwing the shells about with complete abandon.' Sunday morning sidewalks were 'not quite ankle deep' in shells. Merchants would get up early to sweep them into the gutter so churchgoers would not have to wade through them.'"</ref> "Silk City".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Whelan|first=Frank|title=Cement City' Moniker Is A Mystery American Heritage Says Label Was Allentown's.|newspaper=[[The Morning Call]]|pages=B.03|date=May 7, 1991}}.
