| reign = {{circa}} 1010–970 BCE{{Efn | Some scholars think that the biblical description of David reigning for exactly "forty years", like Solomon, is formulaic in nature and not intended as historical, which calls into question our understanding of the exact length of David's reign and the exact years it traverses.{{Refn | Nadav Na'aman, "Was Khirbet Qeiyafa a Judahite City?: The Case against It", ''JHS'' (2017), pp.&nbsp;15–16.}} Some scholars propose that David's rule occupied the middle third of the 10th century BC.{{Refn | H.M.
